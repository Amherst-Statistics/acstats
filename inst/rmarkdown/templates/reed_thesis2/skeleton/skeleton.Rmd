# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

# R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
