  \chaptermark{Introduction} \markboth{Introduction}{Introduction}

  Welcome to the \LaTeX~thesis template. If you've never used \TeX~or
  \LaTeX~before, you'll have an initial learning period to go through, but
  the results of a nicely formatted thesis are worth it for more than the
  aesthetic benefit: markup like \LaTeX~is more consistent than the output
  of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing and the
  resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had
  problems using Word in the past, your thesis is going to be about twice
  as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's
  capabilities. If you're still on the fence about using \LaTeX, read the
  Introduction to LaTeX on the CUS site as well as skim the following
  template and give it a few weeks. Pretty soon all the markup gibberish
  will become second nature.

  \section{Why use it?}

  \LaTeX~does a great job of formatting tables and paragraphs. Its
  line-breaking algorithm was the subject of a PhD.\thinspace thesis. It
  does a fine job of automatically inserting ligatures, and to top it all
  off it is the only way to typeset good-looking mathematics.

  \section{Who should use it?}

  Anyone who needs to use math, tables, a lot of figures, complex
  cross-references, IPA or who just cares about the final appearance of
  their document should use \LaTeX. At Reed, math majors are required to
  use it, most physics majors will want to use it, and many other science
  majors may want it also.

  \chapter{R Markdown}

  This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
  for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
  using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.

  When you click the \textbf{Knit} button a document will be generated
  that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
  chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

  \begin{CodeChunk}
  \begin{CodeInput}
  summary(cars)
  \end{CodeInput}
  \begin{CodeOutput}
       speed           dist
   Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00
   1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00
   Median :15.0   Median : 36.00
   Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98
   3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00
   Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
  \end{CodeOutput}
  \end{CodeChunk}

  Testing citations: \cite{angel2000} {[}@angel2000{]}

  You can also embed plots, for example:

  \begin{CodeChunk}
  \begin{CodeInput}
  plot(cars)
  \end{CodeInput}


  \begin{center}\includegraphics{skeleton_files/figure-latex/plot-1} \end{center}

  \end{CodeChunk}

  \begin{CodeChunk}
  \begin{CodeInput}
  plot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
  \end{CodeInput}


  \begin{center}\includegraphics{skeleton_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} \end{center}

  \end{CodeChunk}

  \section{Bibliographies}

  Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate
  an armful of sources. This is why BibTeX was created. For more
  information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site
  (\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\cite{reedweb2007}
  {[}@reedweb2007{]}. There are three pages on this topic: \emph{bibtex}
  (which talks about using BibTeX, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html}),
  \emph{bibtexstyles} (about how to find and use the bibliography style
  that best suits your needs, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html}) and
  \emph{bibman} (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by
  hand, without BibTeX, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html}). The last page
  will not be useful unless you have only a few sources. There used to be
  APA stuff here, but we don't need it since I've fixed this with my
  apa-good natbib style file.
