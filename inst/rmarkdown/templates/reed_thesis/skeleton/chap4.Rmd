# Tables and Graphics

```{r, results = "asis"}
source("insert.R")
label("reed.jpg", "Reed logo", 0.5, "reed", "figure")
label("subdivision.pdf", "Subdiv figure", 0.75, "subdiv")
```

Here is a reference to the Reed logo: `r ref("reed")`.

And for the subdiv: `r ref("subdiv")`.


## Tables

The following section contains examples of tables.  

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in **R** that you saw in [](#rmd-basics) using the `kable` function, you can also create tables using _pandoc_. (More information is available at <http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables>.)  This might be useful if you don't have values specifically stored in **R**, but you'd like to display them in table form.  Below is an example.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Factors                    Correlation between Parents & Child      Inherited
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
  Education                                -0.49                         Yes
  
  Socio-Economic Status                     0.28                        Slight   
  
  Income                                    0.08                          No
  
  Family Size                               0.18                        Slight
  
  Occupational Prestige                     0.21                        Slight
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
Table: Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child \label{tab:inher_table}

We can also create a link to the table by doing the following:  \autoref{tab:inher_table}.

Note the addition of the `\label{}` option to the end of the table caption.  We can then use the \LaTeX\ `autoref` function to produce the link. `autoref` will automatically add "Table" before your number if you add the "tab:" prefix to your label. Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document, not necessarily right next to the table like we have here.  We will next explore ways to create this label-ref link using figures and equations.

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
  Floats are things like tables and figures. -->


## Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor.  One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter.  You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.  So that you don't have to get too far into \LaTeX\ to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist.  You'll see their use below.

<!--

One thing that may be annoying is the way _R Markdown_ handles "floats" like tables and figures (it's really \LaTeX's fault). \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments to the figure and table environments to specify where you want it to appear; see the comments in the first figure.

If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in the floating environment.

Below we have put a few examples of figures. For more help using graphics and the float environment, see our online documentation.
-->


And this is how you add a figure with a graphic:
\begin{figure}[h]
% the options are h = here, t = top, b = bottom, p = page of figures.
% you can add an exclamation mark to make it try harder, and multiple
% options if you have an order of preference, e.g.
% \begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	   \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	    \includegraphics{subdivision}
	     \caption{A Figure}
	 \label{subd}
	\end{figure}

\clearpage 

<!-- starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures -->

\section{More Figure Stuff}

You can also scale and rotate figures.

 \begin{figure}[h!]
	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	    \includegraphics[scale=0.5,angle=180]{subdivision}
	    % if your figure shows up not where you want it, it may just be too big to fit. You can use the scale argument to shrink it, e.g. scale=0.85 is 85 percent of the original size.
	     \caption{A Smaller Figure, Flipped Upside Down}
	 \label{subd2}
\end{figure}

## Even More Figure Stuff
With some clever work you can crop a figure, which is handy if (for instance) your EPS or PDF is a little graphic on a whole sheet of paper. The viewport arguments are the lower-left and upper-right coordinates for the area you want to crop.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	    	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	   \includegraphics[clip=true, viewport=.0in .0in 1in 1in]{subdivision}
	    \caption{A Cropped Figure}
	 \label{subd3}
\end{figure}

### Common Modifications

The following figure features the more popular changes thesis students want to their figures. This information is also on the web at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/graphics.html>.
      
<!-- \renewcommand{\thefigure}{0.\arabic{figure}} 	 Renumbers the figure to the type 0.x 
\addtocounter{figure}{4} 						 starts the figure numbering at 4 -->
    
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{subdivision}
    \caption[Subdivision of arc segments]{\footnotesize{Subdivision of arc segments. You can see that $ p_3 = p_6^\prime$.}} %the special ToC caption is in square brackets. The \footnotesize makes the figure caption smaller
    \label{barplot}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
