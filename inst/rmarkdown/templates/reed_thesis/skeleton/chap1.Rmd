# R Markdown Basics {#rmd-basics}

Here is a brief introduction into using R Markdown. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  Be careful with your spacing in Markdown documents.  While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give Markdown signals as to how to proceed.  As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph.  In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact it might cause your text to do funny things).

## Lists

### Unordered versus ordered

It's easy to create a list.  It can unordered like

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

or it can be ordered like

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
4. Item 3

Notice that I intentionally mislabeled Item 3 as number 4.  Markdown automatically figures this out!  You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list.  Check it out below.

To create a sublist, just indent the values a bit (four spaces).  (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b

## Line breaks

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:*

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

## R chunks

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots.  For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of others way to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.

## Inline code / Mathematics

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`.


## Loading data / Exploratory Data Analysis

Included in this template is a file called `flights.csv`.  This file includes a subset of the larger dataset of information about all flights that departed from Seattle and Portland in 2014.  More information about this dataset and its **R** package is available at <http://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14>.  This subset includes only Portland flights and only rows that were complete with no missing values.  Merges were also done with the `airports` and `airlines` data sets in the `pnwflights14` package to get more descriptive airport and airline names.

We can load in this data set using the following command:

```{r load_data}
flights <- read.csv("flights.csv")
```

The data is now stored in the data frame called `flights` in **R**.  To get a better feel for the variables included in this dataset we can use a variety of functions.  Here we can see the dimensions (rows by columns) and also the names of the columns.
```{r str}
dim(flights)
names(flights)
```

Another good idea is to take a look at the dataset in table form.  With this dataset having more than 50,000 rows, we won't explicitly show the results of the command below.  I recommend you enter the command into the Console **_after_** you have loaded the **R** chunks above to load the data into **R**.

```{r view_flights, eval = FALSE}
View(flights)
```

While not required, it is highly recommended you use the `dplyr` package to manipulate and summarize your data set as needed.  It uses a syntax that is easy to understand using chaining operations.  Below I've created a few examples of using `dplyr` to get information from about the Portland flights in 2014.  You will also see the use of the `ggplot2` package, which produces beautiful high quality academic visuals.

We begin by checking to ensure that needed packages are installed and then we load them into our current working environment:

```{r load_pkgs, message = FALSE}
# List of packages required for this analysis
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr")

# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the packages not installed to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

The example we show here does the following:

- Select the following variables from the `flights` dataset:  `carrier_name` and `arr_delay`.  Assign this subset to a new variable called `flights2`. 

- Using `flights2`, determine the largest arrival delay for each of the carriers.

```{r max_delays}
flights2 <- flights %>% select(carrier_name, arr_delay)
max_delays <- flights2 %>% group_by(carrier_name) %>%
  summarize(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We next introduce a useful function in the `knitr` package for making nice tables in R Markdown called `kable`.  It produces the \LaTeX\ code required and is much easier to use than manually entering values into the \LaTeX\ code.  This again goes to show how nice reproducible documents can be.  There is no need to copy-and-paste values to create a table.  There are functions written to print data frames from **R** in nice formats.

```{r table_out, results = "asis"}
kable(max_delays, col.names = c("Airline", "Maximum Arrival Delay"))
```

We can further look into the properties of the largest value here for American Airlines Inc.  To do so, we can isolate the row corresponding to the arrival delay of 1539 for American in our original `flights` dataset.

```{r max_props}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay == 1539, 
                   carrier_name == "American Airlines Inc.") %>%
  select(-c(month, day, carrier, dest_name, hour, 
            minute, carrier_name, arr_delay))
```

We see that the flight occurred on March 3rd and departed a little after 2 PM on its way to Dallas/Fort Worth.  Lastly, we show how we can visualize the arrival delay of all departing flights from Portland on March 3rd against time of departure.

```{r march3plot, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
flights %>% filter(month == 3, day == 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

<!--
`kfigr` stuff no longer useful since it doesn't work with PDF.


 ```{r march3plot-code, ref.label = 'march3plot', anchor = "block", eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
 ```

 ```{r march3-plot, ref.label='march3plot', anchor = "figure", echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
 ```
 
 If we'd like to reference the plot we made there, we enter the following inline **R** code:  (backtick)r figr('march3-plot', type = "figure", link = TRUE)(backtick).
