Here is a brief introduction into using R Markdown. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Lists

## Unordered versus ordered

It's easy to create a list.  It can unordered like

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

or it can be ordered like

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
4. Item 3

Notice that I intentionally mislabeled Item 3 as number 4.  Markdown automatically figures this out!

To create a sublist, just indent the values a bit:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b

# Line breaks

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Here is the correct way:*

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

# R chunks

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of others way to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.

# Inline code / Mathematics

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`.
