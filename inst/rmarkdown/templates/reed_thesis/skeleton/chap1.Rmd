\chapter{R Markdown}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r summary}
summary(cars)
```

Testing citations: [@angel2000]

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

\section{Bibliographies}
  Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. This is why BibTeX was created. For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (<http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)[@reedweb2007]. There are three pages on this topic: _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources. There used to be APA stuff here, but we don't need it since I've fixed this with my apa-good natbib style file.
