Welcome to the R Markdown thesis template. This template is based on the \LaTeX\ template, but hopefully will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ before.  (You'll see \LaTeX\ code here and there, but it won't make up a large chunk of your thesis.)  Using R Markdown will also allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output included as well.  The hope is this R Markdown template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis.  The use of \LaTeX\ in combination with Mardkown is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities. If you're still on the fence about using R Markdown, check out the various tutorials available at <http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed> or email us at <data@reed.edu>.  After working with Markdown and R together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward.

\section{Why use it?}

R Markdown creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of \LaTeX\.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with \LaTeX\ and its ability to do a great job of formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to \LaTeX\, R Markdown also allows you to read in your data, analyze it and visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.  You'll see more on this later.  Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a monstrosity of benefits.

\section{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use data analysis in any form, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use R Markdown. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of Markdown and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly all seniors at Reed with their thesis projects.
