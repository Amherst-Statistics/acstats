\chapter{The First}

This is the first page of the first chapter. You may delete the contents of this chapter so you can add your own text; it's just here to show you some examples.

\section{References, Labels, Custom Commands and Footnotes}
It is easy to refer to anything within your document using the \texttt{label} and \texttt{ref} tags.  Labels must be unique and shouldn't use any odd characters; generally sticking to letters and numbers (no spaces) should be fine. Put the label on whatever you want to refer to, and put the reference where you want the reference. \LaTeX\ will keep track of the chapter, section, and figure or table numbers for you.

\subsection{References and Labels}
Sometimes you'd like to refer to a table or figure, e.g. you can see in Figure \ref{subd2} that you can rotate figures . Start by labeling your figure or table with the label command (\verb=\label{labelvariable}=) below the caption (see the chapter on graphics and tables for examples). Then when you would like to refer to the table or figure, use the ref command (\verb=\ref{labelvariable}=). Make sure your label variables are unique; you can't have two elements named ``default." Also, since the reference command only puts the figure or table number, you will have to put  ``Table" or ``Figure" as appropriate, as seen in the following examples:

 As I showed in Table \ref{inheritance} many factors can be assumed to follow from inheritance. Also see the Figure \ref{subd} for an illustration.

\subsection{Custom Commands}\label{commands}
Are you sick of writing the same complex equation or phrase over and over?

The custom commands should be placed in the preamble, or at least prior to the first usage of the command. The structure of the \verb=\newcommand= consists of the name of the new command in curly braces, the number of arguments to be made in square brackets and then, inside a new set of curly braces, the command(s) that make up the new command. The whole thing is sandwiched inside a larger set of curly braces.

% Note: you cannot use numbers in your commands!
\newcommand{\hydro}{H$_2$SO$_4$}

In other words, if you want to make a shorthand for H$_2$SO$_4$, which doesn't include an argument, you would write: \verb=\newcommand{\hydro}{H$_2$SO$_4$}= and then when you needed  to use the command you would type \verb=\hydro=. (sans verb and the equals sign brackets, if you're looking at the .tex version). For example: \hydro

\subsection{Footnotes and Endnotes}
	You might want to footnote something.\footnote{footnote text} Be sure to leave no spaces between the word immediately preceding the footnote command and the command itself. The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on the CUS site.

\section{Bibliographies}
	Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. This is why BibTeX was created. For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (\url{web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\footnote{\cite{reedweb:2007}}. There are three pages on this topic: {\it bibtex} (which talks about using BibTeX, at \url{/latex/bibtex.html}), {\it bibtexstyles} (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at \url{/latex/bibtexstyles.html}) and {\it bibman} (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at at \url{/latex/bibman.html}). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources. There used to be APA stuff here, but we don't need it since I've fixed this with my apa-good natbib style file.

\subsection{Tips for Bibliographies}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
\item The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
\item When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word ``and'' e.g.\\ \verb+Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},+.
\item Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
\item To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
\item You can add a Reed Thesis citation\footnote{\cite{noble:2002}} option. The best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use the optional ``type'' field to enter ``Reed thesis'' or ``Undergraduate thesis''. Here's a test of Chicago, showing the second cite in a row\footnote{\cite{noble:2002}} being different. Also the second time not in a row\footnote{\cite{reedweb:2007}} should be different. Of course in other styles they'll all look the same.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Anything else?}
If you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please contact CUS (email cus@reed.edu) with your suggestions. We love to see people using \LaTeX\ for their theses, and are happy to help.


\chapter{Mathematics and Science}
\section{Math}
	\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.

	If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're not going to use math, skip over this next big red section. (It's red in the .tex file but does not show up in the .pdf.)
%
%% MATH and PHYSICS majors: Uncomment the following section
%	$$\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq {{\beta_i^2}\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}}
%\left[ 2\rho_i^2 + {\delta_i^2\beta_i^2\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
%$$

%From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden):

%After {\it n} such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

%$$
%\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
%   \exp\left(-{(x-\theta)^2\over{2\sigma^2}}\right)\ dx
%$$

%

%Another equation:

%$$\det\left|\,\begin{matrix}%
%c_0&c_1\hfill&c_2\hfill&\ldots&c_n\hfill\cr
%c_1&c_2\hfill&c_3\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+1}\hfill\cr
%c_2&c_3\hfill&c_4\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+2}\hfill\cr
%\,\vdots\hfill&\,\vdots\hfill&
%  \,\vdots\hfill&&\,\vdots\hfill\cr
%c_n&c_{n+1}\hfill&c_{n+2}\hfill&\ldots&c_{2n}\hfill\cr
%\end{matrix}\right|>0$$

%
%Lapidus and Pindar, Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations in Science and
%Engineering.  Page 54

%$$
%\int_t\left\{\sum_{j=1}^3 T_j \left({d\phi_j\over dt}+k\phi_j\right)-kT_e\right\}w_i(t)\ dt=0,
%   \qquad\quad i=1,2,3.
%$$

%L\&P  Galerkin method weighting functions.  Page 55

%$$
%\sum_{j=1}^3 T_j\int_0^1\left\{{d\phi_j\over dt} + k\phi_j\right\} \phi_i\ dt
%   = \int_{0}^1k\,T_e\phi_idt, \qquad i=1,2,3 $$
%
%Another L\&P (p145)

%$$
%\int_{-1}^1\!\int_{-1}^1\!\int_{-1}^1 f\big(\xi,\eta,\zeta\big)
%   = \sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n w_i w_j w_k f\big( \xi,\eta,\zeta\big).
%$$

%Another L\&P (p126)

%$$
%\int_{A_e} (\,\cdot\,) dx dy = \int_{-1}^1\!\int_{-1}^1 (\,\cdot\,) \det[J] d\xi d\eta.
%$$

\section{Chemistry 101: Symbols}
Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around math mode's automatic italicizing by using the argument \verb=$\mathrm{formula here}$=, with your formula inside the curly brackets.

So, $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$ is written \verb=$\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$=\\
Exponent or Superscript: O$^{-}$\\
Subscript: CH$_{4}$\\

To stack numbers or letters as in $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}$, the subscript is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.\\
Angstrom: {\AA}\\
Bullet: CuCl $\bullet$ 7H${_2}$O\\
Double Dagger: \ddag \/\\
Delta: $\Delta$\\
Reaction Arrows: $\longrightarrow$ or  $\xrightarrow{solution}$\\
Resonance Arrows: $\leftrightarrow$\\
Reversible Reaction Arrows: $\rightleftharpoons$ or $\xrightleftharpoons[ ]{solution}$ (the latter requires the chemarr package)\\


\subsection{Typesetting reactions}
You may wish to put your reaction in a figure environment, which means that LaTeX will place the reaction where it fits and you can have a figure legend if desired:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
$\mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6  + 6O_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{6CO_2 + 6H_2O}$
\caption{Combustion of glucose}
\label{combustion of glucose}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other examples of reactions}
$\mathrm{NH_4Cl_{(s)}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH_{3(g)}+HCl_{(g)}}$\\
$\mathrm{MeCH_2Br + Mg} \xrightarrow[below]{above} \mathrm{MeCH_2\bullet Mg \bullet Br}$

\section{Physics}

Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the math page (\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html}) and the Comprehensive \LaTeX\ Symbol Guide (enclosed in this template download).  You may wish to create custom commands for commonly used symbols, phrases or equations, as described in Chapter \ref{commands}.

\section{Biology}
You will probably find the resources at \url{http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html} helpful, particularly the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting (\url{http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html}).  Be sure to read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables, and remember that the thesis template has versions of Ecology and Science bsts which support webpage citation formats.

\chapter{Tables and Graphics}

\section{Tables}
	The following section contains examples of tables, most of which have been commented out for brevity. (They will show up in the .tex document in red, but not at all in the .pdf). For more help in constructing a table (or anything else in this document), please see the LaTeX pages on the CUS site.

\begin{table}[htdp] % begins the table floating environment. This enables LaTeX to fit the table where it works best and lets you add a caption.
\caption[Correlation of Inheritance Factors between Parents and Child]{Correlation of Inheritance Factors between Parents and Child}
% The words in square brackets of the caption command end up in the Table of Tables. The words in curly braces are the caption directly over the table.
\begin{center}
% makes the table centered
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
% the tabular environment is used to make the table itself. The {c c c c} specify that the table will have four columns and they will all be center-aligned. You can make the cell contents left aligned by replacing the Cs with Ls or right aligned by using Rs instead. Add more letters for more columns, and pipes (the vertical line above the backslash) for vertical lines. Another useful type of column is the p{width} column, which forces text to wrap within whatever width you specify e.g. p{1in}. Text will wrap badly in narrow columns though, so beware.
\toprule % a horizontal line, slightly thicker than \hline, depends on the booktabs package
  Factors &  Correlation between Parents \& Child & Inherited \\ % the first row of the table. Separate columns with ampersands and end the line with two backslashes. An environment begun in one cell will not carry over to adjacent rows.
  \midrule % another horizontal line
	Education 				& -0.49 & Yes 	 \\ % another row
	Socio-Economic Status 	& 0.28 	& Slight \\
	Income 					& 0.08 	& No	 \\
	Family Size 			& 0.19 	& Slight \\
	Occupational Prestige 	& 0.21 	& Slight \\
\bottomrule % yet another horizontal line
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{inheritance} % labels are useful when you have more than one table or figure in your document. See our online documentation for more on this.
\end{table}

	\clearpage
%% \clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
%% Floats are things like tables and figures.

If you want to make a table that is longer than a page, you will want to use the longtable environment. Uncomment the table below to see an example, or see our online documentation.

%% An example of a long table, with headers that repeat on each subsequent page: Results from the summers of 1998 and 1999 work at Reed College done by Grace Brannigan, Robert Holiday and Lien Ngo in 1998 and Kate Brown and Christina Inman in 1999.

   \section{Figures}

	If your thesis has a lot of figures, \LaTeX\ might behave better for you than that other word processor.  One thing that may be annoying is the way it handles ``floats'' like tables and figures. \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies.   There are some optional arguments to the figure and table environments to specify where you want it to appear; see the comments in the first figure.

	If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in the floating environment.

	To get a figure from StatView, JMP, SPSS or other statistics program into a figure, you can print to pdf or save the image as a jpg or png. Precisely how you will do this depends on the program: you may need to copy-paste figures into Photoshop or other graphic program, then save in the appropriate format.

	Below we have put a few examples of figures. For more help using graphics and the float environment, see our online documentation.

	And this is how you add a figure with a graphic:
	\begin{figure}[h]
	% the options are h = here, t = top, b = bottom, p = page of figures.
	% you can add an exclamation mark to make it try harder, and multiple
	% options if you have an order of preference, e.g.
	% \begin{figure}[h!tbp]

	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	    \includegraphics{subdivision}
	     \caption{A Figure}
	 \label{subd}
	\end{figure}

\clearpage %% starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures

\section{More Figure Stuff}
You can also scale and rotate figures.
 	\begin{figure}[h!]

	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	    \includegraphics[scale=0.5,angle=180]{subdivision}
	    % if your figure shows up not where you want it, it may just be too big to fit. You can use the scale argument to shrink it, e.g. scale=0.85 is 85 percent of the original size.
	     \caption{A Smaller Figure, Flipped Upside Down}
	 \label{subd2}
	\end{figure}

\section{Even More Figure Stuff}
With some clever work you can crop a figure, which is handy if (for instance) your EPS or PDF is a little graphic on a whole sheet of paper. The viewport arguments are the lower-left and upper-right coordinates for the area you want to crop.

 	\begin{figure}[h!]
	    	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	   \includegraphics[clip=true, viewport=.0in .0in 1in 1in]{subdivision}
	    \caption{A Cropped Figure}
	 \label{subd3}
	\end{figure}

      \subsection{Common Modifications}
      The following figure features the more popular changes thesis students want to their figures. This information is also on the web at \url{web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/graphics.html}.
    %\renewcommand{\thefigure}{0.\arabic{figure}} 	% Renumbers the figure to the type 0.x
    %\addtocounter{figure}{4} 						% starts the figure numbering at 4
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{subdivision}
    \caption[Subdivision of arc segments]{\footnotesize{Subdivision of arc segments. You can see that $ p_3 = p_6^\prime$.}} %the special ToC caption is in square brackets. The \footnotesize makes the figure caption smaller
    \label{barplot}
    \end{center}
    \end{figure}
