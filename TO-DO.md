1. Create labels for figures/tables stored as pictures (not necessarily **R** created).
  - Likely taken care of by using this:  <https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref>
  - Maybe some guidance here?  <https://github.com/balachia/pandoc-filters>
  - Or here? <https://gist.github.com/balachia/d836f8829aec61cb4b54#file-pandoc-internalref-hs>
  - Or here? <https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos>
  - Currently using `kfigr` package, but doesn't create link to figure/chunk in PDF (does with HTML)
1. Number equations
  - Maybe using this? <https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos>
1. Show how to create tables using Markdown and other examples using **R**
1. Show how to scale images
1. Test other citation styles and make sure they match Reed College library requirements
1. Check with library about shading code
